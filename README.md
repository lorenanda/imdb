# Most popular movies of 2018

In this project, I used R to scrape the most popular movies in 2018 from the IMDb website, which I then analyzed in terms of duration and genre, and eventually visualiazed the results in a Tablau dashboard.

## Tools
- for web-scraping: rvest
- for data visualization: ggplot, Tableau
