# Most popular movies of 2018

In this project, I used R to scrape the most popular movies in 2018 from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250), which I then analyzed in terms of duration and genre, and then visualized the results in a Tableau dashboard. 

## Tools
- for web-scraping: rvest
- for data visualization: ggplot, Tableau
